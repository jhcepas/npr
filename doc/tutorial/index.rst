NPR Tutorial
**************

Nested Phylogenetic Reconstruction (NPR) is a novel methodology that
addresses phylogenetic inference as an iterative process by which the
resolution of internal nodes is gradually refined from root to leaves
in an automatic way. The following documentation refers to the `npr`
program, a command line application allowing to apply the NPR strategy
on top of variety of predefined phylogenetic workflows.

If you use this program for published work, please cite the following
