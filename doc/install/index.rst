Portable package
*********************

Since ETE-NPR depends on many external software, the portable package
is the recommended way for installation. 

ETE-NPR portable package is much larger than the regular download and
introduces a little overhead in the overall execution of pipelines
(just few secs when starting up the application). However, it
encapsulates all the necessary software, libraries and configuration
to make the execution of pipelines compatible with any modern linux
distribution. 

Latest version of the portable package can be found at
http://npr.cgenomics.org Just download, uncompress and use.
