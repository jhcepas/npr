This document describes how to install ETE-NPR from sources in a Linux
environment. Note that the recomended approach for most of the users is to use
the portable or virtual package available at http://etetoolkit.org/ete_npr.

However, building ETE-NPR from sources will provide a better performance than
the portable packages.
   

1. Install dependencies
==============================

  python
  python-numpy
  python-qt4 (optional, required for image generation)
  python-lxml (optional)
  python-mysqldb (optional) 

You will need also basic tools for compiling (gcc, g++). As an examples, the
'build-essential' package (in ubuntu) should be enough. You may also need to
install 'automake' and 'autoconf'
  
Some of the external programs require special libs that might not be installed. Most commonly: 

   libargparse-dev


2. Download the sources for external applications
=======================================================

You need to clone the following repository* at the root* of the npr/ directory:

   $ cd npr/
   $ git clone http://github.com/jhcepas/ext_app 

3. Compile external applications
===================================

Enter the ext_app directory and run the compile script

   $ cd npr/ext_apps/
   $ sh compile.sh all

4. Check that the applications are detected and operative
==========================================================

   $ cd npr/
   $ ./npr check
