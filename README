              Nested Phylogenetic Reconstruction (NPR) program.
                            ETE-NPR (beta).

    ETE-NPR is a bioinformatics program providing a complete environment for
    the execution of phylogenomic workflows, including super-matrix
    and family-tree reconstruction approaches. ETE-NPR covers all
    necessary steps for high quality phylogenetic reconstruction, from
    alignment reconstruction and model testing to the generation of
    publication ready images of the produced trees and alignments. ETE-NPR is
    built on top of a bunch of specialized software and comes with a number
    of predefined workflows. 
     
    If you use ETE-NPR in a published work, please cite:
     
       Jaime Huerta-Cepas, Peer Bork and Toni Gabaldon. In preparation. 
     
    (Note that a list of the external programs used to complete the necessary
    computations will be also shown together with your results. They should
    also be cited.)
