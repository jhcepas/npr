For portable execution, please do not modify the directory structure
or the location of files.  If you want to add "npr"" and "nprtop""
commands to your path, add this directory to your PATH variable or
use symbolic links. 

For instance, you can add a line like the following to your .bashrc
for make npr command permanently accesible:

$ export PATH=/my/path/to/npr:$PATH;
