    ETE-NPR: a portable application for Nested Phylogenetic
             Reconstruction and worflow design. 
=============================================================    

Nested Phylogenetic Reconstruction (NPR) is a novel methodology that
addresses phylogenetic inference as an iterative process by which the
resolution of internal nodes is gradually refined from root to leaves
in an automatic way. ETE-NPR is a command line application built on
top of the ETE library which provides NPR capabilities for a broad
range of phylogenetic workflows, ranging both gene and species tree
reconstruction approaches. In addition, it provides a portable
templating platform that allows to encapsulates all the details about
the execution of a complete phylogenetic pipeline into a single
configuration file, thus providing full reproducibility of
phylogenetic analyses.
