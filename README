    ETE-NPR: a portable application for Nested Phylogenetic
             Reconstruction and worflow design. 
=============================================================    

  NPR allows to reconstruct large phylogenies by means of an iterative
  strategy that provides scalable resolution along the different
  levels of a tree. At each iteration, internal nodes are re-evaluated
  to optimize and fine tune the parameters of the phylogenetic
  inference.

  (Note that a list of the external programs used to complete the
  necessary computations will be shown after each execution)
