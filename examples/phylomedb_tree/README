This example shows how to produce a phylogenetic tree using the workflow
described in the phylomeDB database (phylomedb.org), which includes a meta
aligning strategy, gap trimming, evolutionary model selection and maximum
likelihood tree inference.

RUN THE EXAMPLE: 

npr -a Phy0008D92_HUMAN.msf.aa -w phylomedb4 -o results 

Given that this is a quick example, we could accelerate the process by reducing
the scheduling time between tasks.

npr -a Phy0008D92_HUMAN.msf.aa -w phylomedb4 -o results -t 1 --launch_time 1 -v2


If you are curious about the workflow configuratio, you can always run 

npr show phylomedb4

to see how different tasks are executed
