This example shows how to produce a phylogenetic tree using the workflow used by
the phylomeDB database (phylomedb.org), which includes a meta aligning strategy,
gap trimming, evolutionary model selection and maximum likelihood tree
inference.

Only a FASTA file is required to start the process. 

To test it, you can run the shell script run.sh. 

Feel also free to vary the command line used in such example (cat run.sh) and
explore new options by invoking the npr program with the "-h" argument

Note that you will need to remove the output directory or use run.sh --clearall
to restart the analysis, otherwise precomputed from previous sessions will be
used.
