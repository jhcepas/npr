This example shows how to use ETE-NPR to produce species trees based on
concatenated alignments. For this, only a fasta file (containing the species
proteome sequences) and a COG file (containing the list of Cluster of
Orthologous groups) are necessary.

To run this (dummy) example, you will need to:

1) Decompress the file proteome_seqs.fa.7z with the 7-ZIP application
(http://www.7-zip.org/download.html), probably available in your software
repository.

2) Execute npr with the following options. Choosing sptree_dummy as the
supermatrix workflow will restrict to the concatenation of 5 alignments.:

$ npr -m sptree_dummy -w clustalo_default-none-none-none --cogs cogs.txt \
    -a proteome_seqs.fa -o results/

3) To run it in recursive way, you just need to add the --recursive flag

$ npr -m sptree_dummy -w clustalo_default-none-none-none  --cogs cogs.txt \
    -a proteome_seqs.fa -o results/ --recursive


Note that the chosen genetree workflow do not include model-selection and tree
build steps, thus reducing the time required the species tree. More elaborate
examples are possible, although they may take hours of computation even in
multi-core systems. In example: 

$ npr -m sptree-raxml-85 -w meta_aligner_default-trimal01-prottest_default-none \
    --cogs cogs.txt -a proteome_seqs.fa -o results/ --recursive --cpu 8
