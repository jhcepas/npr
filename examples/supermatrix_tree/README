This example shows how to use the ETE-NPR program to produce a species
phylogenetic tree based on concatenated alignments. For this, only a fasta file
containing species proteome sequences and a COG file containing the a list of
Cluster of Orthologous groups are necessary. 

To use this example, you will need to:

1) Decompress the file proteome_seqs.fa.7z with the 7-ZIP application
(http://www.7-zip.org/download.html), probably available in your software
repository.

2) Run the example as: 

npr -w sptree_fast linsi_fasttree  --cogs cogs.txt -a proteome_seqs.fa -o results/
