This example shows how to use the ETE-NPR program to produce a species
phylogenetic tree based on concatenated alignments. For this, only a fasta file
containing species proteome sequences and a COG file containing the a list of
Cluster of Orthologous groups, is necessary. 

Additionally, a lineages file can be provided in order to pre-define the clades
that will be optimized using the NPR strategy. 

To use this example, you will need to:

1) Decompress the file proteome_seqs.fa.7z with 7-ZIP
(http://www.7-zip.org/download.html), probably available in your software
repository.

2) call run.sh

3) remove the output directory or use run.sh --clearall to restart the analysis,
   otherwise precomputed from previous sessions will be used.
